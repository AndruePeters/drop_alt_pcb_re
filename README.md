# drop_alt_pcb_re
Re Process of Drop Alt with some potential modification. The goal is to be 100% compatible with Drop's firmware while providing some benefits such as south facing LED's and 5-pin switches. The LED one might come later because it might affect the foam layout. 


License:
I'm not sure of the proper license. This is labeled as an RE, but it's not a true RE effort. I'm not sure of the legalities, so instead this can be considered
a new PCB that is compatible with Drop's firmware and fits in their cases. If something pops up this is subject to change. If you are a normal user, feel free to borrow from this. If this is for profit, then I must be contacted. I'm mostly concerned with Drop potentially stealing this if it gets mature enough because their engineer's did a horrible job on their Alt PCB.
